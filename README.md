I’m an aspiring cybersecurity professional with a deep curiosity for technology and a hands-on approach to learning.

## Objective
My passion for cybersecurity has driven me to build enterprise-grade home labs, simulate attacks, and configure defenses. I focus on Active Directory security, SIEM log analysis, and network forensics. I am actively seeking to apply these skills in a professional SOC environment as a Tier 1 Analyst.

## Projects

### 1. [Splunk Detection Lab (Active Directory)](https://github.com/SHAHID1100HACK/Splunk-Detection-Lab)
Built a Windows Domain environment, ingested logs into Splunk, and wrote SPL queries to detect Brute Force (Hydra) and Kerberoasting attacks.

### 2. [Wazuh EDR & Monitoring](https://github.com/SHAHID1100HACK/Wazuh-Lab)
Deployed Wazuh Manager to monitor Linux endpoints. Configured File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) and detected web attacks (SQLi/XSS).

### 3. [Network Traffic Analysis](https://github.com/SHAHID1100HACK/Network-Analysis)
Analyzed PCAP files using Wireshark to identify malware handshakes. Wrote Python scripts to automate IP extraction from logs.
