I’m an aspiring cybersecurity professional with a deep curiosity for technology and a hands-on approach to learning.

## Objective
Aspiring SOC Analyst who prefers the terminal over textbooks. I build my own security tools, manage a custom home lab for log analysis, and practice defense against simulated attacks daily. Ready to bring a proactive, 'figure-it-out' mindset to a professional security team.
