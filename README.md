# Hello, I'm SHAHID

[![LinkedIn](https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn-Connect-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin)](YOUR_LINKEDIN_URL_HERE)

I'm an aspiring Cybersecurity Analyst transitioning from Python development to Blue Team operations. I build home labs to simulate attacks, analyze logs, and I'm currently exploring how AI agents can automate incident response.

## Objective

My goal is to secure a **Tier 1 SOC Analyst** role. I don't just study theory; I build the infrastructure. From configuring Firewalls to hunting threats in Wazuh and Splunk, I am documenting my journey to show I can handle real-world incidents.
